# Measuring availability
- Availability is commonly measured in uptime percentages.
- The <span style="color:rgb(216, 203, 251)">higher the percentage</span>, the <span style="color:rgb(216, 203, 251)">lower the downtime allowed</span> over a given period.
- SLA (Service Level Agreements) guarantee specific availability levels, defining the maximum allowable downtime.
