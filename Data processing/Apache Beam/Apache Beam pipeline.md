A Beam pipeline is a graph of all the <span style="color:rgb(216, 203, 251)">data computations in a data processing task</span>.
- The pipeline execution happens in a runner either through the <span style="color:rgb(216, 203, 251)">SDK directly</span> or the <span style="color:rgb(216, 203, 251)">Runner API's RPC interface</span>.
